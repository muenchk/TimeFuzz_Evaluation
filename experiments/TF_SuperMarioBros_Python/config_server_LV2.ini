[Fixes]

\\ The ExecutionHandler sleeps whenever there are no tests running and

\\ have been issued. This setting disables the sleep option for the 
\\ handler.
\\ This option results in increased cpu usage if there are no tests running.
\\ This is independent and has no interactions with the [TestEnginePeriod] setting.
DisableExecHandlerSleeping = true

\\ Sometimes when compiling with gnu tests seem to run into a timeout, even though
\\ they do not actually do that. This only occurs when compiling with GCC and 
\\ may cause wrong results to surface or progression to be stuck.
\\ This setting repeats tests that ran into a timeout in an attempt to get the proper result.
\\ Only use this if you are sure your tests are not running into actual timeouts.
\\ [The preferred solution for this is to set the oracle result to Repeat within the lua oracle.]
